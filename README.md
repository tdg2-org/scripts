# DFX
- This version is automated. Verified on U96 with three RPs and three RMs each.
- RMs must be in folders named RM* in hdl directory.
- Each RM must have same module name.
- RM folders are parsed to get module names.
- RP instance in static region MUST be named "<RM module name>_inst"
  - Ex. RM0 = "led_cnt_pr", instance in io_top must be "led_cnt_pr_inst".
- Currently, only one full config is built. This will be the 'first' RM for each RP which are sorted ASCII.
  - Empty static is also built, there is an option to disable this in 'imp.tcl'.
  - All partial bitstreams are generated.
- No VHDL. Verilog and systemverilog only.
